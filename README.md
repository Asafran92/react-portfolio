# Professional Portfolio

## Description

Using React, create a professional portfolio to showcase my work.
The site was generated with a mobile first approach. As such, the site displays properly across across all media widths. The site also uses "Getfolio" to capture user imput in the form section.

## Testing Instructions

Once on the site, a user can click on a the nav bar header to be taken to a section of the site. The navbar uses "react smooth scrolling" for a nice user experience.

## Screenshot og app in use:
